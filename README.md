# Design-Patterns
Final project in the course Design Patterns conducted in Java for the business logic, JavaFX for GUI, and MySQL for designing the DB.

**Project vision:** 
An application that helps drivers to find a nearby parking spot that is free. The application will be a form of social media, in order to establish a community of drivers that helps each other, each user will be able to find available parking spots in real-time.

**Application functionality:**
-Users can send reports to other users, providing information on parking spots status (available, taken, blocked, etc..), also the users can like other users' reports.
-The main assumption of the project is that there is a single parking spot for each address or coordinate (to simplify the idea of the project).
-In addition, the project has the capabilities of a single user so I decided to make every non-logged user into a bot that will send and like reports and will be dynamically located, the bot will switch parking spots at every permanent time.
